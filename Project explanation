This project is a simple, single-page web application designed as a nutrition tracker. Built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and a little bit of JavaScript, it allows users to input their daily intake of key macronutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and fibers. The application automatically calculates and displays the total amount for each nutrient in real-time as the user types. Its clean, dark-themed interface is optimized for quick and easy use, making it a handy tool for anyone tracking their gym nutrition goals.
